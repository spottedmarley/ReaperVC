# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM COMMANDS - EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE
# ============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: The commands in this file are EXAMPLES ONLY!
#
# They demonstrate advanced features like:
#   - text_input (typing text via xdotool)
#   - text_delay (waiting for UI to be ready)
#   - press_key (pressing keys like Return/Escape)
#   - key_delay (timing between actions)
#
# These example commands may:
#   - Use custom actions you don't have installed
#   - Not work on your system without modification
#   - Override default commands (if they share the same command_name)
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#   1. Review the examples to learn the syntax
#   2. Comment out or delete the examples you don't need
#   3. Add your own custom commands
#   4. Commands here OVERRIDE any matching commands in default_commands.yaml
#
# TIP: Keep this file clean! Only include commands you actually use.

#  Command data structure:
#
#  command_name               Identifying key for this command
#  patterns                   A list of spoken words or phrases to be listened for
#                             to trigger the action
#  action_name                In REAPER action list, right click your desired action
#                             and 'Copy selected action text'. Paste into action_name
#                             (e.g., "Transport: Play" NOT the ID number)
#  text_input                 Text to be typed via xdotool (requires xdotool installed)
#                             Useful for naming tracks, entering values, etc.
#  text_delay                 Wait time (in seconds, e.g., 0.3) after action executes
#                             before text_input is typed. Allows UI to be ready.
#  press_key                  Key to press via xdotool after text is typed
#                             (e.g., "Return" to confirm, "Escape" to cancel)
#  key_delay                  Wait time (in seconds, e.g., 0.05) after text_input
#                             before press_key is executed
#  description                Describes the action. Shown in telemetry and terminal output
#  available_during_recording Boolean (true/false). If false, command is ignored while
#                             recording is active. Prevents accidental interruptions.

#  Example command structure:

#
# All commands defined in this file take precedence over any identical
# commands found in default_commands.yaml. If a command definition here
# uses the same command_name as one from the default list, it will completely
# override the default. For safe modifications to default commands, you can
# copy the command from default into this file and make changes here. Recomend
# that all your customizations to the command list be made here to preserve
# the orignal default_commands file.
