# Default Command Mappings
#
#  Command data structure:
#
#  command_name               Identifying key for this command
#  patterns                   A list of spoken words or phrases to be listened for
#                             to trigger the action
#  action_name                In REAPER action list, right click your desired action
#                             and 'Copy selected action text'. Paste into action_name
#                             (e.g., "Transport: Play" NOT the ID number)
#  text_input                 Text to be typed via xdotool (requires xdotool installed)
#                             Useful for naming tracks, entering values, etc.
#  text_delay                 Wait time (in seconds, e.g., 0.3) after action executes
#                             before text_input is typed. Allows UI to be ready.
#  press_key                  Key to press via xdotool after text is typed
#                             (e.g., "Return" to confirm, "Escape" to cancel)
#  key_delay                  Wait time (in seconds, e.g., 0.05) after text_input
#                             before press_key is executed
#  description                Describes the action. Shown in telemetry and terminal output
#  available_during_recording Boolean (true/false). If false, command is ignored while
#                             recording is active. Prevents accidental interruptions.
#
#  Example command structure:
#
#  {command_name}:
#    patterns:
#      - "spoken phrase 1"
#      - "spoken phrase two"
#      - "a third spoken phrase"
#    action_name: "Action: Reaper action to perform"
#    text_input: "This is a cool action"
#    text_delay: 0.3
#    press_key: "Return"
#    press_delay: 0.5
#    description: "An action was performed!"
#    available_during_recording: false
#
# These default commands are optimized for a 'solo recording' workflow
# but everything can be changed to suit your needs or you can add new
# commands. Recommend adding and overriding default commands by editing
# custom_commands.yaml, which is processed after this default command list
# allowing any commands with identical command_name(s) to override
# these defaults.
