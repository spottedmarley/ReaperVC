# ReaperVC OSC Configuration

# Make REAPER follow device selection
# This means /track/name will work on the track that the device (ReaperVC) selects
REAPER_TRACK_FOLLOWS DEVICE
DEVICE_TRACK_FOLLOWS LAST_TOUCHED

# Use default OSC patterns - these are inherited from Default.ReaperOSC
# No need to redefine TRACK_NAME, TRACK_RECARM, etc.
